In this livestream I explain how to use Docker for Windows to create a cybersecurity Homelab. 

One of the most widely use methods of learning cybersecurity is to create a "homelab": simple, inexpensive, software and hardware to test cybersecurity defense and simulate attacks.

It is trivial to learn cybersecurity attack techniques and there are countless online free or paid platforms to execute attacks. However, learning the harder tasks of defending systems or the underlying application development and systems administration practices requires a complex setup. 

It is common for people to use spare hardware switches, routers, firewalls, and servers. For years, I used VMware workstation on desktops with multiple SSDs and lots of RAM so I could simulate a dozen VMs. 

But is there an easier way? Can we simulate hundreds of systems on a desktop. With Docker, I think we can.

As with all Technical Tuesday livestreams, I will be "flying by the seat of my pants" and experimenting unrehearsed. I will be doing on my first Docker lab complete with servers, workstations, and an attacker. 

Let's see how far we can get!
