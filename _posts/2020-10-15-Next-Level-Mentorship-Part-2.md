Moro & Mike will be joined by [Kristin McVeigh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kristin-mcveigh-5267284a/), IABC Calgary Co-Director for Mentorship Career Services ([International Association of Business Communicators, Calgary Chapter](http://iabccalgary.com/) ).

This is Part 2 in our series on mentorship.

Cybersecurity lacks the same tradition of mentorship found in other established professions. What can we do to take mentorship to the next level?

Kristin comes from a professional society that has an established program for encouraging mentorship and matching mentors and mentees. I love it when we bring people from outside IT and cybersecurity in to show us how other professions do things. Join us as Kristin shares her perspective!
