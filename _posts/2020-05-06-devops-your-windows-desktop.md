Do you want to automate software deployment on your Windows Desktop? Want to use containers to keep your experiment and tests clean and separate? Want to use Linux on Windows with complication? You need to mix a tiny bit of DevOps into your Windows Desktop.

I have published notes based on this demonstration on LinkedIn.

This livestream was an explanation of how I rebuilt my Windows Desktop with a bit of DevOps influence to simplify my life and automate (most of) the things!  

I will take questions and show-and-tell and maybe you can share your stories as well.
