This is our first Threat Intelligence live stream. We will be highlighting and comparing current threat intelligence reports from a variety of sources.

This is the time of year when several of the major Threat Intelligence/Threat Landscape reports come out from major vendors and analysts. We are going to break them down and compare them for you.

Michael will give an introduction to the concept of threat intelligence and then we will summarize the most recent reports.
