In this livestream we are joined by [Emilie Vincent, RPR](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emilievincentyyc/) to discuss how to deal with rejection both as a job seeker and as a hiring manager. Emilie is known for her deliberate and thoughtful approach to providing feedback to job candidates and for advising hiring managers and on how to be more actively involved in the hiring process.

With advise and wisdom from Emilie we will discuss the “behind the scenes” view of how strong candidates get rejected over other strong candidates.

In [a 2015 survey from LinkedIn Talent Solutions](https://business.linkedin.com/content/dam/business/talent-solutions/global/en_us/c/pdfs/global-talent-trends-report.pdf) 95% of jobs candidates expect feedback, but only 41% get any and 43% never hear anything at all after applying for a job. The experience of job seeking and hiring involves rejection. As a job seeker you will experience feelings of rejection and proceed with no feedback. 

As hiring manager, your behaviour can directly impact your future ability to hire. LinkedIn's survey found that 66% of candidates developed negative feelings toward the hirer when there is no feedback.

Questions we will tackle:

- How can job seekers deal with feelings of rejection?
- How can hiring managers provide meaningful feedback to job seekers?
- What should you say when someone doesn’t get the job?
- What can you say when someone doesn’t get the job?
- “I thought was perfect for that role? How did I not get it? Why won’t they tell me?”

As always we will take your LIVE Questions and answer them!

Join us Thu Aug 6 at 7 PM MDT.
