[A short curated YouTube playlist introducing Emotional Intelligence](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwO8Dz1s6R5EtkxVPjv365KC_EUMBW_uj)

In the first part of our series on Cybersecurity/IT Leadership we will be discussing Emotional Awareness and Emotional Quotient (EQ). 

Moro and I will introduce the topic and discuss it's meaning and importance. Michael will provide several learning resources.

We will interview a guest who is an outstanding role modem for Emotional Awareness and learn what value it brings to their leadership style.

As always we will take live Q&A after the interview.

NOTE: WE HAVE MOVE TO THURSDAY NIGHT. 

To give you more room on Friday now that it is summery.
