Cybersecurity is unique due to the number and variety of certifications available. Certification is often considered essential to get hired or a barrier to entering the profession.

In this livestream we will discuss question such as:

  - Do I need to get certified?
  - What certifications exist? How are they different?
  - How hard are they to get?
  - Which ones are "the best?" 
  - How many certifications do I need?
  - What experience do I need?

Moro, Mike, and guest Mark Shykula will help you navigate the cybersecurity universe maze, and we have a highly certified guest to share his experience and answer your questions.

: Jerimy's infographic is an interesting attempt to classify and visual cybersecurity certifications. The list is comprehensive and is ranked by degree of difficulty and categorized by type-of-work.

It begs the question, "Why are we obsessed with becoming hackers?"
