Cybersecurity is unique due to the number and variety of certifications available. Certification is often considered essential to get hired or a barrier to entering the profession.

In this livestream we will discuss question such as:

  - Do I need to get certified?
  - What certifications exist? How are they different?
  - How hard are they to get?
  - Which ones are "the best?" 
  - How many certifications do I need?
  - What experience do I need?

Moro, Mike, and guest Mark Shykula will help you navigate the cybersecurity universe maze, and we have a highly certified guest to share his experience and answer your questions.

ISC2. [May 12, 2020]. (ISC)2 CISSP Certification Now Comparable to Masters Degree Standard. ISC2 News. <https://www.isc2.org/News-and-Events/Press-Room/Posts/2020/05/12/ISC2-CISSP-Certification-Now-Comparable-to-Masters-Degree-Standard>

# Resources
This is a list of resources to help you explore Cybersecurity Certifications

Jerimy, Paul. (2020). Security Certification Roadmap. <https://pauljerimy.com/security-certification-roadmap/>
: Jerimy's infographic is an interesting attempt to classify and visual cybersecurity certifications. The list is comprehensive and is ranked by degree of difficulty and categorized by type-of-work. While the ranking is somewhat subjective I was say that it is reasonably accurate. Importantly, Jerimy's work highlights the deficency in training and certification on defense. It begs the question, "Why are we obsessed with becoming hackers?"

GIAC. (2020). Trust Me, I'm Certified. Podcast. <https://www.giac.org/podcasts>
: This podcast promoting GIAC certification addresses a wide variety of topics related to SANS Institute training and certification including imposter syndrome, SANS Institute training, career development, and mentorship. It is a relatively new podcast showcasing a new professional and topic each episode.

ISACA. [n.d.] CSX Cybersecurity Fundamentals Certification. <https://www.isaca.org/credentialing/cybersecurity/csx-fundamentals-certificate>
: I found the book for this to be one of the best, most concise, guides to define what cybersecurity is and is not. It's short, well written, and easy to read. A great and inexpensive starting point. There is also an inexpensive exam to go with it. A great starting place for ANYONE in IT.
