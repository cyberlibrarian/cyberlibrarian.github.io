# The Cybersecurity Librarian Blog
This is the github repository used to build my blog: [The Cybersecurity Librarian](https://cyberlibrarian.ca/).

This README file contains the instructions I use to remind myself how I build and maintain the site. You probably just want to read the blog.

## Overview

This blog is currently hosted on GitHub Pages (github.io) using Jekyll and the minima theme. I have customized the minima theme files to support special types of pages and posts.
