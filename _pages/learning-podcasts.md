The Cybersecurity Librarian recommends these 3 podcasts. They have these attributes:

- Original Content
- Quality Analysis

The Cyberwire
I believe this is the gold standard for general daily cybersecurity news. The content is timely.  The producers actively minimize, disclose, or state bias. The information is accurate and authoritative. The sources they choose are well selected and authoritative. I have seen them state when a source was not primary. The analysis is insightful. The style of the primary host (Dave Bittner) is charming, wry, and still effecient and professional. The guests are well choosen and diverse. While the revenue model they have (advertising/sponsorship) does bias their selection of guests, the interviews themselves appear to be far less bias than other similar shows. 

Malicious Life
An extraordinary documentary-style podcast. The host Ran Levi is an engaging presenter and selects worthy topics from the history of cybercrime. What makes this podcast worth listening too is how the producers take complicate timelines of events, balance the detail required, and tell the story of major historical cybersecurity events. There is occaisional bias, but the hosts are good at stating it (mostly). The accuracy and historical detail of the content are impressive. They manage to balance the level of historical and technical detail and tell an entertaining and educational story.

Darknet Diaries
: *Bias Caution* Darknet Diaries is an extraordinary podcast: entertaining, unique, and much needed. The host has an obvious bias and frequently states, as fact, his opinion about the motivations of the people he interviews. Jack Reysider is a compelling storyteller and engaging interviewer which makes it hard for the audience to notice the bias. Are the people he interviews antisocial criminals or misunderstood geniuses? Be concious of the host's bias and draw your own conclusions.

## Notes

There are a few podcasts that are quite popular that The Cybersecurity Librarian does not recommend. While popular they lack qualities that make the others outstanding or have "quality" issues or a track record of avoidable bias. Basically, if the hosts are sexist, hyperbolic, narracistic, or present personal rather than professional opinions, I'm not going to recommend it. I'm not saying don't listen to them, I'm saying, "Listen with a critical mind." VICE Motherboard's "CYBER" for example, or "Security Weekly" are both entertaining and engaging, but CYBER makes avoidable factual errors, presents instinct as evidence frequently. Security Weekly cultivates sexism and hyperbole for the sake of being entertaining. Today, we have so many choices, it simply isn't necassary to embrace the unstated bias of these podcasts.

There I did it. I called out two of the most popular cybersecurity podcasts like a good librarian.
