This is a list of high-quality audio-only podcasts 

## Top 3

The Cybersecurity Librarian recommends these 3 podcasts. They have these attributes:

- Original Content
- Quality Analysis

[The Cyberwire](https://www.thecyberwire.com/)
: I believe this is the gold standard for general daily cybersecurity news. The content is timely.  The producers actively minimize, disclose, or state bias. The information is accurate and authoritative. The sources they choose are well selected and authoritative. I have seen them state when a source was not primary. The analysis is insightful. The style of the primary host (Dave Bittner) is charming, wry, and still effecient and professional. The guests are well choosen and diverse. While the revenue model they have (advertising/sponsorship) does bias their selection of guests, the interviews themselves appear to be far less bias than other similar shows. 
: The Cyberwire has a number of spin-off podcasts on the topics of Social Engineer, Cybersecurity Law, Security and Vulnerability Research, and Security Management. Each strikes its own balance of entertainment, education, and original content. Each relies on unique and authoritative guests.

[Malicious Life](https://malicious.life/)
: An extraordinary documentary-style podcast. The host Ran Levi is an engaging presenter and selects worthy topics from the history of cybercrime. What makes this podcast worth listening too is how the producers take complicate timelines of events, balance the detail required, and tell the story of major historical cybersecurity events. There is occaisional bias, but the hosts are good at stating it (mostly). The accuracy and historical detail of the content are impressive. They manage to balance the level of historical and technical detail and tell an entertaining and educational story.

[Darknet Diaries](https://darknetdiaries.com/)
: Darknet Diaries presents stories of recent cybercrimes and interviews with cybercriminals, hackers, and penetration testers. Despite the title, the stories are not about the Darknet per se, but about criminal hacking and world of those that compromise security. The topics are diverse, the storytelling is compelling, and interviewed guests are unique. This will give you more than just an entertaining look at cybercrime, it allows us a window into the minds of the people behind many well known security incidents. You will hear first hand accounts from criminals and here them state their motivations, tell their life stories, and explain their actions.
: *Bias Caution* The host has an obvious bias and may state, as fact, his opinion about the motivations of the people he interviews. The show may also fail to verify the accuracy of statements made by the guests: sometimes the guest's word is taken as fact. The compelling storytelling and engaging interviews makes it hard to notice this bias. Are the people he interviews the misunderstood geniuses they claim to be or are they antisocial criminals? Be concious of possible bias and draw your own conclusions.
: *Personal Comment* It is the professional duty of librarians to identify bias and help people navigate complex presentation of ideas whether in books, articles, or podcasts. As a cybersecurity professional, The Darknet Diaries bias makes my blood boil, but I believe it is a necassary bias that makes the how work, and it is vital that cybersecurity defenders hear these stories. We have our own biases to be concious of as well. It is OK to call the guests of show criminals, and to hope they are held to account. It is also OK to be fascinated by their stories and to hope they "make good" of their lives.

## News / Threat Intelligence

[Recorded Future Podcast](https://www.recordedfuture.com/resources/podcast/)
: Recorded Future is a company that offers Threat Intelligence services. Their podcast is hosted by Cyberwire host Dave Bittner, and presents interviews with professionals involved in Cyber Threat Intelligence work. Unlike many other vendor podcasts, this one does not focus exclusively on interviewing their own staff and includes many people throughout the industry. It is not a sales-focused marketing initiative and the treatment of topics and selection of guests does not appear to be overly biased.

## People and Profession

[Moro and Mike]({{site.baseurl}}/moro-and-mike/podcast.rss)
: Available in iTunes/Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify and others, this is the audio-only recording of the weekly Moro and Mike YouTube livestream. The show focuses on professional development issues, not technical training and tries to bring many guests from outside Cybersecurity to help us develop a better profession.

## Privacy, Law, and Policy

[Caveat](https://www.thecyberwire.com/podcasts/caveat)
: Caveat is hosted by Cyberwire's Dave Bittner and Lawyer Ben Yelin. You do not have to be a lawyer to enjoy or learn from this podcast. It discusses recent cybersecurity news and events that are impacted by law.

[Privacy Insider](https://wirewheel.io/resources/the-privacy-insider/)
: Hosted by Justin Antonipllai, the former Under Secretary for Economic Affairs at the US Department of Commerce, this podcast takes a serious look at law, policy, and social issues related to privacy. *The Cybersecurity Librarian has yet to render a verdict on bias. It is sponsored, but the content seemed more "privacy geek" than marketing.*


## Management and Leadership

[Dev.Sec.Lead](https://www.devseclead.com/)
: Hosted by Threat Intelligence author Wilson Bautisa Jr., this podcast focuses on leadership development. It is of interest not just to CISOs and managers, but also for the every-day professional. The interview and topics vary greatly and the depth the topics are treated is refreshing. These guests are positive role models focused on improving our profession.
