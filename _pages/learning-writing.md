Writing is a vital skill in cybersecurity. Even those in highly technical roles will be required to write clear concise technical documentation, procedures, and playbooks. Those involved in the assessment of risk, threats, and vulnerabilities will benefit from strong report writing skills. Managers and Consultants have the greatest need to develop effective communication and persuasive writing abilities.

The resources listed on this page will help you develop your writing skills, no matter what your role and need. Please share with us anything that you found helpful. The most useful, clear, and authoritative resources will be added to this list.

[Ten Steps to Help you Write Better Essays & Term Papers](https://www.uregina.ca/library/assets/docs/pdf/e_books/Essaybook.pdf)
: This book by Neil Sawer is concise and practical. It doesn't make you learn theory, it tells you what actions to take, right now, to start writing. Then it tells you want you can do to edit your writing and improve it. While this book is focused on students, the advice applies generally to anyone suffering from writers block, or who finds themselves challenged to write more clearly or briefly.

: Also from Neil Sawer, this book uses some of the same writing advice from "Write Better Essays" and applies it to the business world. There is more emphasis on persuasive writing and on communicating with visuals, charts, etc.


## Writing for Penetration Testers and Vulnerability Assessment

*If you have additional or better examples, templates, or writing guides for pentration testers, please let us know!*

Penetration Testers rarely start as excellent writers. Some, but not all, start their careers following less formal paths and do not benefit from the learning that only comes when you are required to present your thoughts in writing. Do not let anything stop you from becoming a great writer! Your observations and discoveries benefit nobody if they cannot be communicated and understood. It is up to you to make that happen. Sadly, there are few good resources to help out the motivated pentester to write a good report.

Start with learning how to write a narrative report: the most common and easiest type of pentest report. "Easy" is relative. Most people can easily write a narrative report, but it takes practices and feedback to write a good one. Like pentesting, you get better with practice and with harder and harder challenges.

I recommend Offensive Security's advice on narratives (but not their assertion that a narrative is the same as a pentest report). 

When you get good at writing your narrative reports, and consistently include verifiable proof of testing as well as verifiable findings, it will be time to practice writing more complete reports (your narrative report is just an appendix to the actual report the client will want). Clients need background, context, risk rankings, and evidence-based recommendations. It is not easy, but it just takes practice. Sadly, again, there are not many good examples to learn fromm. I recommend starting with this SANS Paper by Alharbi (2010).

## Project Propoals and Statements of Work

If you work as a consultant you will need to write Statements of Work (SOWs) frequently. These are brief summaries that contain a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) and estimated effort. They do not fully describe a Scope of Work, but are enough to authorize work when a client has trust and clear understanding. 

Consultants and employees with initiative will have to write Project Proposals or Plans. These are larger detailed documents that explain the background and need for a project, the detailed scope, a Work Breakdown Structure, estimated effort, requirements for the project, roles of the parties involved, estimates of cost, and more.
