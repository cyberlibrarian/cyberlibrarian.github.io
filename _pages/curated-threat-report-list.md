# Overview
If you work in cybersecurity, you face a difficult reality: constantly changing threats. What worked to defend your organization last year (or month) may not work today. Your adversaries partially dictate your operational tempo. When they innovate you must match their pace or you will be left unaware of your vulnerability and exposure.

A constantly changing threat landscape frequently means that no cybersecurity program is complete and there is always too much to do. To succeed, you will necassarily need to set priorities based on "threat-risk": *estimates of the liklihood that a threat could have a material impact on you in the near future*. 

But how do you stay informed as to what threats are relevant to you? Which should be viewed a risk that requires mitigation in the near-term? That is where having a well curated list of threat reports helps.

I use this list to keep myself informed and adjust my understanding of shifts in the threat landscape annually.

# Categories of Report
I categorize these reports using several demensions:
1. Frequency of Publication
2. Type of Publisher
3. Scope of Report
4. Focus of Report

## Frequency of Publication
This list is intended for strategic insights. I only include in this list reports that are infrequently published: annually or quarterly. This is to give you a look back at the trends to look for patterns that might indicate a trend. 

Should you track sources more frequently? Yes, but daily, weekly, and monthly reports forecast threats that require immediate operational or tactical adjustments. You need a collection process for that: your sources will change frequently.

Where possible, I include the rough time-of-year when annual reports are expected. Some are predictably published in specific months or quarters. It helps to know when to go looking!

## Type of Publisher
It helps to understand the bias and context of each report. Commercial vendors often publish reports. Despite being marketing tools, certain vendors have unprecendented or unique insight into threats. Government organizations also supply report but the context or scope may bias their view: do they only analyze Nation-based cyber-espionage and ignore cybercrime? Do they only focus on fraud that targets indviduals?

## Scope of the Report
The scope of the report is important. Some have a global focus, others limited to a specific customer base or Nation. I have no fixed vocabluary for these but I attempt to identify the scope.

## Focus of the Report
You should have some diversity in your curated list. You need to consider cybercrime, geopolitics, IT/OT, cyberware, fraud etc. So I identify the focus as best as I can so I can later consider if I have enough sources for each of my priority requirements.
