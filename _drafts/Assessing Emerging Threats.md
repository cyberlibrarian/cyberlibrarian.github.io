# Overview

Frequently, organizations need to respond to threats

# Defining an Emerging Threat

## Examples

# When should we conduct an Emerging Threat assessment?


- Zero-day Vulnerabilities
- Reports of mass exploitation
- Supply-chain vulnerabilities
- Cyber-threat Intelligence Advisories



# A Threat Model for Assessing Emerging Threats

# Definitions

Vulnerability
: A weakness in a system that can be exploited to cause adverse impact to the system or the people that depend on it. Vulnerabilities are typically features of a system, often defects, that lead to unexpected adverse 

Threat
: Activity that could exploit a vulnerability to cause adverse impact.

Risk

Threat Action / Capability
: A tactic, technique, procedure (TTP) or tool used to execute a threat action.

Threat Actor
: A cluster of actions, or an entity with the motivation and/or capability to carry out Threat Actions, that could exploit a vulnerability.
